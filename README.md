# AOP: Adaptive Orthogonal Prior for Function Sequences

This repository provides R code implementing adaptive orthogonal prior for orthogonal function sequences, implemented in Bayesian functional principal component analysis, as proposed by the following paper.

Sugasawa, S. and Mochihashi (2025). On Prior Distributions for Orthogonal Function Sequences. [arXiv:2508.15552](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15552)

The repository includes the following 3 files.

- `Demo.R`: Script for example using simulated data 
- `FPCA-AOP`: Script implementing Bayesian functional principal component analysis with AOP
- `FPCA-NO`: Script implementing Bayesian functional principal component analysis without orthogonal constraint
